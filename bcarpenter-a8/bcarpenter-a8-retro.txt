Ben CarpenterMarch 27, 2022A8 RetrospectiveI think that this project was a great way for me to hammer home to importance of spec-ing out a project before working on it. After doing my white board drawings, I had a clear outline of how I wanted the game to look, feel, and function. Looking back, I wish I had taken more time to think about how to incorporate implementation details into my original spec. I knew how I wanted the end to look, and the connections between the game states, so it didn’t end up being a huge hurdle in this project, but I still would have benefited by thinking about it earlier. To fix this in later projects, I will focus on asking myself, “how will I get from this state to another?” when drawing lines connecting wireframes. I also wish I had more time to work on this project; it was a lot of fun! Next time I work on a project, I will make sure to include a priorities list, to make sure that I get all the basics down before I add polish. On this one, I found the deadline approaching before I had all the basics where I wanted them. Another issue that I ran into was native code compilation. I was able to run the build command without errors, but the executable did not work. I believe that this is an issue with loading my assets from an external folder. I do not yet know how to fix this bug, but I have asked in the Ruby 2D Discord server. I am hopeful that I will get a reply soon and / or the documentation will be updated with more information regarding this issue!I would like to note that I drew inspiration from my memory of a classic iPod game (called parachute, I believe), however I did not look at any references to it.In completing this project, I frequently referred to the Ruby 2D documentation, and worked with our TA Waka. Attributions for all the art assets used can be found on my README in the project GitHub repo.
